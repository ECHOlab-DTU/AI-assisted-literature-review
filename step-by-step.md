# Literature Visualizations

The first part of the workshop series focused on finding relevant liteature.
In this session we go through a number of tools and open-source software to visualize the literature scapes in different ways.
Visualizations can help to show relations of aspects such as keywords or authors in the literature, or can give an overview over the development of a body of literature on a certain topic.

### tools used in this tutorial: 

[ScienceScape](https://medialab.github.io/sciencescape/)
[Table2Net](https://medialab.github.io/table2net/)
[GephiLite](https://gephi.org/gephi-lite/)
[Cortext](https://managerv2.cortext.net/login)
[TUT](https://tut.man.dtu.dk)


## Step 1 - Download data as a csv file

In this example we use scientific literature from [Scopus](https://www.scopus.com).
When downloading the list of publciations and entities as a csv file, remember the following:

- select all
- export as csv
- include abstracts & keywords

There is a limit to the number of articles that can be downloaded at a time. 
If you wish to include more than the given number in your file, you have to download the results in different steps and merge them into one csv file manually.


## Step 2 - Visualizing in ScienceScape

ScienceScape works with the csv data from Scopus or alternatively Web of Science and turns them into visualizations. 
There are a number of visualization types to choose from.
